// this is an advanced way to use mq with custom params and multiple files

// first we create a customMQ partial that will have all the overrides for mq
@use 'customMQ';
// Since we already use 'mq' inside  'customMQ' and this is our first file been called, we have set
// mq with custom params for all files.
// So whenever we do `@use '../mq'` we will be using our custom implementation
